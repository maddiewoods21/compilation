    <h3 class="header-one"><a><em>What Screens Want</em></a> by Frank Chimero, <a><em>What is Code</em></a> by Paul Ford</h3>

      <p class="first">
      In the readings this week, <a>What Screens Want</a> and <a>What is Code?</a>, Chimero and Ford grapple with complex questions using rhetoric intended to be accessible to even the most inexperienced audiences. Laying out their explanations with plenty of white space, illustration, metaphor, and humor, each author uses their article as a platform to visually manifest their own ideologies/capabilities through design. Business Week’s creative team was clever in their use of color, interaction, meme culture, and animation to engage readers in what could have been a much more dry and daunting 38,000 word feature (the ‘certificates of completion’ are an especially fun & cheeky touch.
      </p>


      <p>
      Both authors are cautious not to scare off their readers too quickly—crafting #relatable introductions and guiding us gently through their respective line of reasoning. Ford made me feel incrementally more prepared for this class, and I am fully on board with the idea that as a general public, we should probably be more literate about the things we are so addicted to. His insights into ‘coder culture’ gave me a better picture of the industry, and I appreciated his attention to the gender discrepancies, but there were moments where it felt like he was defining the “typical” coder in ways that left people out.
      </p>

      <p class="last">
      I found Chimero’s logic compelling and his suggestions legitimate through most of the essay until he introduced the ‘Map,’ where things got a bit muddled. While his recognition of the urgent inequality and imbalance of power inherent in the world wide web and its interfaces is totally precedented, I didn’t feel like he was able to offer any solutions (other than ‘we have to build it’), making the end of the piece feel quite hollow.

    <h3 class="header-two"><a><em>The Vernacular Web</em></a> by Olia Blank, <a><em>Jodi’s Infrastructure</em></a> by Blank</h3>


      <p class="first">
    Both readings this week were helpful as jumping off points for project 2. <a>The Vernacular Web</a>felt like a trip through time. Tracing through conventions of the web since its inception, Olia made clear that visual metaphor was as important to early pioneers of the World Wide Web as it was to the creators of early graphic interfaces (as discussed in Chimero's essay.) The “Under Construction Sign” and textured/photographic backgrounds oriented amateurs in a familiar space with recognizable elements.
      </p>

      <p>
      When Olia says, “it was the web of the indigenous… or the barbarians,” she raises the idea that there are two very different ways of reflecting on the culture of this “era” of the internet. Those who think it “barbaric” are colonizers of sorts, imposing their own ideologies onto a space they have no claim to… I’ve always thought of early web design as ugly and almost laughable, but perhaps that opinion is worth reconsideration. I was inspired by the many-to-many spirit of the early web, which has been lost to commercialization, and think it’s worth our time to try to bring some of that back. The broken links throughout the essay were frustrating. Otherwise, the format of this article suited the author’s intentions, but—perhaps unintentionally—it manifested the shortcomings of the very features it described.

      <p class="last">
      <a>Jodi’s Infrastructure</a> acted as an introduction to a form of art that exists not just online, but within the internet browser, using its infrastructure as a medium. I always find it interesting to think about the relationship between traditional, physical pieces of art and emerging digital art, like Jodi’s. The former is the world’s most lucrative commodity good, while the latter functions in the realm of media and communication rather than just in the realm of mere creative production—the work within is not commodified, but instead self-referentially focuses on digitality and only exists in a digital space. Raising questions similar to those raised in the 70’s at the onset of Performance art, Galloway and the art of code insist that we expand existing conceptualizations of art.
